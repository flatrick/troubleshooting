# Process Monitor (Windows Sysinternals)

This is the tool that you'll hate long before you begin to love it. 

* It can help you find bottlenecks in performance in more ways than one
  * I/O-performance in terms of response time per every single I/O-request (both local storage and network)
  * I/O-performance by showing amount of bytes per second
  * CPU-performance by measuring the amount of time spent between two operations
  * Total amount of CPU time spent in either **User Time** or **Kernel Time**
  * **Network response time/bandwidth** by looking at **duration time** for a operation of X amount of bytes
